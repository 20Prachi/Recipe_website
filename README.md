The project is a simple Recipe Website built using HTML and CSS. This website aims to provide a clean, user-friendly interface where users can browse through a variety of recipes for cooking. The focus is on structure, layout, and styling using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript or back-end technologies.

Key Features:
Homepage:

The homepage presents an attractive landing page with a title (e.g., "Delicious Recipes"), a navigation menu, and a list of featured recipes with images and brief descriptions.
The layout is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes, from desktop to mobile devices.
Recipe Pages:

Each recipe page includes detailed information, such as ingredients, preparation steps, cooking time, and servings.
Images of the dish and step-by-step instructions are neatly organized.
Navigation:

A fixed navigation bar at the top allows users to easily jump between sections like "Home," "Recipe Categories," "Contact," and "About."
The design uses clean links and buttons styled with CSS.
Recipe Categories:

The recipes are divided into categories (e.g., "Breakfast," "Lunch," "Dinner," "Desserts") to make browsing easier.
Each category page showcases a grid layout with images and short descriptions of different recipes.
Typography & Color Scheme:

A pleasing color palette with soft tones for background and bold accents for headings and buttons.
The website uses web-safe fonts, making it easy to read and visually appealing.
Responsive Design:

The website layout is fully responsive using CSS media queries, ensuring the site looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
Footer:

A footer section with copyright information, links to social media, and contact details.
Technologies Used:
HTML: To create the structure of the website, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
CSS: To style the webpage, manage layout, colors, typography, and ensure a responsive design.
The main goal of this project is to create a functional and visually appealing recipe website, focusing on the aesthetic elements of layout and design without using any dynamic or interactive features.
